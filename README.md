# Web scraping examples

Some examples showing various web scraping techniques.

You will need to download node.js to run these:

I suggest you also install Visual Studio Code:

https://code.visualstudio.com/

Then open the directory containing these files.

From there, start a Terminal window in Visual Studio Code and initialise the modules we need:

    npm install axios
    npm install cheerio    
    npm install objects-to-csv
